# DataGlove_arduino
Arduino code for collecting data from wearable dataglove which contains arduino nano, 2 MPU6050 sensors, 1 flex sensor and HC05 bluetooth module. The schematic of the dataglove is as shown in the image above. We can use a Bluetooth terminal found in app store to view the data send by the dataglove. Mpu6050 library is required which can be imported in arduino IDE from manage libraries option.
